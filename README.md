# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Perform an analysis for an investment bank, who is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its clients. The analysis will include the cryptocurrencies in the market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The first step is to process the data to fit the machine learning models. Since you don't know the outcome of what you have decided to use unsupervised learning, a clustering algorithm.

## Results

The model was built in 4 steps:

- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
